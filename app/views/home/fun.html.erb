				Having the Orlando youth assembly with us was extremely a blessing. Words can’t really describe how much they blessed us in the service. The song they sang , they words the shared with God’s people was amazing. 
				
				We  all felt the  presence of the Lord was in the room.They were excited to be with us, we were encouraged by them. Their testimonies was living testimonies, you could see how much  the Love the lord, and how they seeking for the Lord. That allow us to know that we are not alone in this race; we all are fighting the good to make it. .</p>

					<p>The Glory of God
Our first major goal is the glory of God. Our greatest concern is that His Name be great among the nations, from the rising to the setting of the sun (Malachi 1:11), and that the Lamb who was slain might receive the full reward for His sufferings (Revelation 7:9-10). We find our great purpose and motivation not in man or his needs, but in God, His commitment to His own glory, and our God-given desire to see Him worshipped in every nation, tribe, people, and language. We find our great confidence not in the Church’s ability to fulfill the Great Commission, but in God’s unlimited and unhindered power to accomplish all He has decreed. </p>

			<h3>
What is your Goal?</h3>
				
				<p>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
				Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</p>
